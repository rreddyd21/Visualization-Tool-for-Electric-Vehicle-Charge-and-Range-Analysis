🚗 Visualization Tool for Electric Vehicle Charge and Range Analysis


📌 Project Overview

This project is a data visualization tool that helps analyze electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns and range performance. It uses interactive dashboards created in Tableau to explore key insights such as charging time, energy consumption, battery health, and range statistics.

🎯 Objective

To develop a user-friendly visual tool that:

Helps users understand EV performance

Supports decision-making related to EV adoption

Analyzes patterns from real-world EV datasets

📊 Features

Dashboard for EV charging behavior

Visualization of range performance by manufacturer

Comparison of energy usage across driving conditions

Trends in battery health and efficiency over time

🚗 Dashboard 1: Introduction Page

Scenario:

A user visits the tool for the first time and lands on a visually appealing welcome screen with an illustration of an electric vehicle. They click “Next” to begin exploring the EV insights.

⚡ Dashboard 2: Top Speed & Efficiency of EV Brands

Scenario:

An EV enthusiast wants to compare the performance of different EV brands. They look at:
The top speed to understand which brands offer powerful vehicles (e.g., Volkswagen or Audi).
The efficiency chart to see which brands give maximum range per charge (like Tesla or Byton).

🚙 Dashboard 3: Brands by Body Style

Scenario:

A customer prefers a specific body style (e.g., SUV or Sedan) and wants to see which brands offer those styles. This dashboard helps them identify:
Tesla offers SUVs, Sedans, Pickup, etc.
Volkswagen offers many Hatchback models.

🔌 Dashboard 4: Charging Stations & Price Comparison

Scenario:

A buyer planning to shift to EVs wants to:
Check which regions have good EV charging infrastructure.
Compare prices of different EV models available in India (e.g., MG ZS EV vs. Audi E-Tron GT).

🗺️ Dashboard 5: Charging Station Map & Powertrain Filter

Scenario:

A policymaker or infrastructure planner wants to know:
The geographical spread of EV charging stations.
Brands categorized by powertrain types like Hybrid, Battery Electric, etc.

🏷️ Dashboard 6: Number of Models by Brand

Scenario:

An EV showroom wants to stock the most popular brands. They use this dashboard to see:
Tata has multiple EV models (Tigor EV, Nexon EV, Nexon EV Max).
Audi and BMW have a decent presence too.

🧱 Dashboard 7: Different EV Models

Scenario:

A customer wants to see a quick overview of available EV models in India without focusing on specifications. This treemap shows model names and their relative representation.
